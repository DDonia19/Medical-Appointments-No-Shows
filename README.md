# Medical-Appointments-No-Shows
This is my first data analysis project that I completed for my Data Analysis Nanodegree with Udacity.
Tha main purpose is to know the steps involved in a typical data analysis process and be confortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset
and then answering those questions. Besides of knowing how to use Matplotlib, Pandas and Numpy.
